# Howzit, builders 🤙🏼

I want to help build the future of Hawaiʻi and the world. Here's what I'm building now:

- 🛠 Engineeing & UI/UX Design Intern at @PauboxHQ
- 🐻 Computer Science + Entrepreneurship + Ethics at UC Berkeley '22
- 🌍 Project lead writing code for social good with @CalBlueprint

My large codebase contributions tend to be on private repositories and projects, but feel free to find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nickwongio) if you'd like to chat about my work. Until then, you can view my public repos documenting my web dev experimentation in high school.
