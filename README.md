# Howzit, builders 🤙🏼

I'm an experienced Full-Stack Developer and User Interface Designer studying at UC Berkeley. I'm an aspiring founder passionate about improving elderly care, leveraging entrepreneurship to uplift his local community, and increasing representation for native Hawaiians in technology.

I want to help build the future of Hawaiʻi and the world. Here's where I'm building now:

- 🛠 Engineeing & Developer Advocacy at [@PauboxHQ](https://www.paubox.com/)
- 🐻 Computer Science + Entrepreneurship + Ethics at UC Berkeley '22? Go Bears!
- 🌍 Project Lead writing code for social good with [@CalBlueprint](https://calblueprint.org/)

My larger codebase contributions tend to be on private repositories and projects, but feel free to find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nickwongio) if you'd like to hear and chat about my work. Also, checkout my [conference presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ia21ZmHJKA) at Paubox's digital health conference talking about leveraging APIs to combat the spread of COVID19. Lastly, feel free to view my public repos documenting my web dev experimentation in high school.
