# Howzit, builders 🤙🏼

I want to help build the future of Hawaiʻi and the world. Here's where I'm building now:

- 🛠 Engineeing & UI/UX Designer at [@PauboxHQ](https://twitter.com/PauboxHQ)
- 🐻 Computer Science + Entrepreneurship + Ethics at UC Berkeley '2? Go Bears!
- 🌍 Project lead writing code for social good with [@CalBlueprint](https://calblueprint.org/)

My larger codebase contributions tend to be on private repositories and projects, but feel free to find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nickwongio) if you'd like to chat about my work. Until then, you can view my public repos documenting my web dev experimentation in high school.
