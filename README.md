# Howzit, builders 🤙🏼

I'm an experienced Full-Stack Developer and User Interface Designer now transitioning into a product role at Paragon [@useparagon](https://useparagon.com). I'm an aspiring founder passionate about improving elderly care, leveraging entrepreneurship to uplift my local community, and increasing representation for native Hawaiians in technology.

I want to help build the future of Hawaiʻi leveraging technology. Here's what I've been building:

- 👨🏻‍💻 PM helping dev teams deliver integrations more efficiently at [@useparagon](https://useparagon.com)
- 🛠 Ex-Engineeing & Developer Advocacy at [@PauboxHQ](https://www.paubox.com/) encrypting communication in healthcare.
- 🐻 Computer Science + Data Science + Entrepreneurship at UC Berkeley. Go Bears!
- 🌍 Project Lead writing code for nonprofits with [@CalBlueprint](https://calblueprint.org/)

My larger codebase contributions tend to be on private repositories and projects, but feel free to find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nickwongio) if you'd like to hear and chat about my work. Also, checkout my [conference presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ia21ZmHJKA) at Paubox's digital health conference talking about leveraging APIs to combat the spread of COVID19. Lastly, feel free to view my public repos documenting my web dev experimentation in high school.
